Things to do to run the Modified MuJoCo Environment:
1. Go to *venv/lib/python3.7/site-packages/gym/envs/mujoco, here substitute *venv with your virtual environment address, and switch to the 
correct python version that you used in your environment (I used python3.7). 
2. Replace ant.py and humanoid.py file in the current directory.
